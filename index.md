# HI! I am Kirthana...Welcome to my portfolio!

# An aspiring future Engineer...building for a better tomorrow!
**Welcome to my profile!!**

Namaste! I am Kirthana, an aspiring Electronics Engineer. My deep interest in Mathematics, Computer Programming, and physics introduced me to electronics. Ever since I have learned about the field of Electronics, specially VLSI and discovered Verilog Programming, it opened a whole new world for me, along with this current evolution in the era of AI.
In my second year, one of our professors recommended reading the Electronics4U magazine, and I used to read its free online version. During this time is when I remember discovering the concept of chip-design and AI Hardware Design, which seemed exciting, as an electronics engineering student, which is why I decided to pursue learning about AI.
This idea has bloomed, and today, in India, there is a lack of Electronics, especially in the area of AI Hardware Design. As a nationalist, I aspire to contribute to nation-building, through my role as an engineer, in this field, and contribute to budding Indian AI and Semicondutor Sector, in making India a successfully reliable and developed nation, in these Sectors.
